# Simple Chess with AI and UI

I like to play chess, and I like programming, so I thought, it would be interesting to make a chess game. Here it is.
You are able to play it in browser against AI, cause it's written on JavaScript and has an UI (made with Canvas).
I hope this may be usefull or interesting for someone.
